- Use Safari web browser for opening the `.mobileconfig` to recieve the install prompt.

## Note

If you're not comfortable installing from the website, you can also install straight from GitLab.com by navigating to a profile (in Safari) within [/mobileconfig](https://gitlab.com/nitrohorse/ios14-encrypted-dns-mobileconfigs/-/tree/master/mobileconfig) and selecting "Open raw." For example, this is 42l's DoH profile from the repo:
